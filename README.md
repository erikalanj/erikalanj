- Hi, I’m Erik Jensen, an undergrad (class 2026) at Central Connecticut State University with a concentration in Computer Science and an already
  completed minor in Mathematics!
  
- I’m interested in anything computer science, particularly some elements of computer security and software engineering

- I’m currently learning how to analyze algorithms at a high level, am building on my programming repetoire (more languages)
  and am diving into some introductory skills in cybersecurity
  
- I’m looking to collaborate on exciting important projects, with elements that would reinforce the skills I already have, and foreign ones
  which will challenge my knowledge
  
- How to reach me:

      Through text/call; 203-217-2427
